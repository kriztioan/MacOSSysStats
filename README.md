# MacOS System Stats

## Description

Here is a collection of small, highly efficient C/C++/Obj-C programs for gathering MacOS system stats. These programs are particularly useful when combined with software like [Ãœbersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/), [GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/), [NerdTool](http://mutablecode.com/apps/nerdtool.html), and others, that let their users run system commands and have the output displayed on the desktop. Notably, these small programs avoid the need to use cli-programs like `ps`, `top`, `netstat`, etc., who's output typically needs to be manipulated with tools like `awk`, `grep`, etc. Conveniently, most of the programs provided here have their output formatted as [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

## Usage

Each sourcefile has as a preamble with a compile command. For example, `battery_mac.c` shows the following:

```C
/**
 *  @file   battery_mac.c
 *  @brief  Battery Status
 *  @author KrizTioaN (christiaanboersma@hotmail.com)
 *  @date   2021-07-17
 *  @note   BSD-3 licensed
 *
 *  Compile with:
 *    clang -O3 -Weverything -Wno-poison-system-directories battery_mac.c
 *    -o battery -framework IOKit -framework Foundation
 *
 ***********************************************/
```

In the above case, an executable named `battery` is created.

## Notes

1. `freq_mac.c` requires [Intel Power Gadget](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-power-gadget.html) to be installed.
2. `netstat_mac.c` outputs simple text rather than in JSON.
3. `inet_mac.c` is a network monitor.
4. `NStatManager.h` contains Apple's private `NetworkStatistics` API.
5. `notify.c` is a `NSUserNotification` replacement for the [Growl](https://growl.github.io/growl/) framework. Be aware that MacOS versions Catalina and later now use `UNUserNotification` instead of `NSUserNotification` and incompatibilities might arise when on those MacOS versions.
